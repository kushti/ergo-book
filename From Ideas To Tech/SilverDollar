“You’ve always had this power, my dear.” said Glinda to Dorothy. “Close your eyes, tap your heels together three times, and think to yourself: there is no place like home.” 

When the Wizard of Oz was released in Technicolor in 1939, Dorothy wore ruby red slippers to usher in Hollywood’s golden age, displacing the silver screen. But in Frank Baum’s turn of the century novel, “The Wonderful Wizard of Oz”, Dorothy’s slippers were silver. 

The book was written before the Federal Reserve Act, but after the Panic of 1893, in which business closures, currency devaluation, and bank runs caused massive immiseration, marking the end of the Gilded Age. The reserves of the federal government had been depleted, calling into question their ability to maintain the gold standard. JP Morgan marshalled the Wall Street banks to lend the US Treasury 35 million ounces of gold, in order for the panic to dissipate. 

The National Banks of the late 19th century were a fractional reserve system, backstopped with federal bonds, and with some actual gold and silver coinage to satisfy demands to redeem banknotes in specie. In other words, after the Civil war, a standard national paper dollar was made legal tender everywhere, and it could be redeemed for silver or gold at any national bank. It was an optimistic system that allowed for economic activity based on risk and credit, but that optimism sometimes brought disappointment, followed by uncertainty, fear, and a rush to the exits (bank runs for coinage). Gold and silver were the base money then, and they also circulated with the paper dollar as the broad currency.

Baum’s book was written in that context: The Yellow Brick Road was the gold standard, leading to the Emerald City, where the Wizard of Oz (ounces) emanated the emerald illusion that dollars and gold were equivalent - even though there were many more dollars available than gold to back them. But the wizard was just an ordinary man behind a curtain, who had nothing to offer the heroes of the story except for recognition of the traits and gifts that were innately theirs all along. Dorothy’s silver slippers were all the magic needed to instantly return her home to her heart’s desire. Baum, a bimetallist, believed that silver coinage would provide sufficient liquidity for commerce, without the need for paper dollars.

Gold has always been too scarce to serve as a broad currency for any society organized enough to mine, refine, and mint gold coins. In every preindustrial state, there were always alternative monetary commodities and credit arrangements. Silver also came out of the refining process, and it was scarce, yet more plentiful than gold. It could be made durable in certain alloys, and was easy enough to mint. The same was essentially true for nickel and copper. These lesser coins could be produced and distributed in much greater quantities, enabling commerce to flourish among the people. Accepting these coins for payment feels natural, and has for millennia. But the industrial revolution made copper, nickel, and eventually silver very valuable to industry, thus complicating their monetary application. 

Paper money arose in the form of notes, cheques, bills, invoices, and so on. Whether or not it was written down, debts and credit have been a part of human interaction since before coinage: I will pay you a cord of firewood in a month, after you make my axe. The Parable of the Talents explains the relationship between money and debt quite adeptly: money and property are just tools to invest and use to make life better. Coinage may be easy to understand, but without credits and debts, trading coins would only work for a limited form of commerce. When commerce expands beyond those limits, into arrangements, contracts, and law, then a standardization of accounting for debts becomes necessary. Banks especially needed standards, and governance; and that’s how debt became a currency, with the insistence of the government and law, in the form of standardized paper notes, for your convenience. 

The fractional reserve nature of this paper currency balanced the conservative wisdom of the bankers against the optimistic nature of markets and people. But when the bank became overextended, people were inclined to exchange their paper money into gold and silver, which they would take home and secure on their own. But silver was finding many industrial uses, such as film and print production, and therefore it was becoming increasingly expensive to mint into coins. The government was reluctant to provide enough silver for commerce, especially when they were already finding it tough to mint and deliver enough gold. The Coinage Act of 1873 essentially deprecated silver, while the western gold rush made gold plentiful enough to use for the base currency, underlying the federal bonds, that underlay the dollars printed around the young nation. 

The National Bank system was fragile and difficult to regulate, leading to another financial panic in 1907. These repeated panics required [enabled] elite bankers to bail out the failed regional banks; but only after many people, farms, companies, and local banks went bankrupt. This recapitalized the system, but did not inspire any long-term confidence in the paper dollar as money. In fact, during his 1912 testimony before congress, JP Morgan famously said that “Gold is money. Everything else is credit.” He was advocating for a new (federalized) central bank that was well capitalized upon the back of a federal government that would hoard and protect its gold reserves. A bank with branches throughout the nation, but under a single charter with the unique ability to manage a broad paper currency on behalf of the federal government. Then any local, regional, or even national bank could lend out that broad money, based on their reserves at the “Fed”. This Federal Reserve bank would ensure the gold standard, and let the private banks take the risks. It was a single corporation under federal law, mandated to maintain a fractional reserve of gold at 40% of the total supply of Federal Reserve notes (the new USD). 

Unfortunately, the Federal Reserve failed to prevent still more crashes and panics, in spite of being the “bank of last resort”. After victory in WWI, the “roaring twenties” created a speculative bubble within the private banks and precipitated the Great Depression. The Federal Reserve bank had reached its 40% gold reserve limit, and could not print more dollars. Business failures, a plummeting stock market, and over-leveraged investors led to the destruction of much of the wealth among the depositor base in the private banks. Bank runs again led to bankruptcy, but this time people were willing to take the paper dollars if that was all that was on hand, since that is all that was promised. A subtle change had transpired, legally and culturally: people began to accept that Federal Reserve notes were as good as gold. 

The Franklin Roosevelt administration spearheaded a number of legal changes to the Federal Reserve and the private banks. All of these actions were meant to reinforce the notion that your dollars were as good as gold. The Glass-Steagall Act prevented commercial banks from making investments, and prevented investment banks from taking on depositors. It also created the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), to reassure depositors that even if their local bank went bankrupt, their deposit was still insured. We created an enormous number of federal agencies and jobs, paying the people in paper dollars, not gold. We set up the Social Security system, forcing private companies to enact a tax on their employees, creating a dollar denominated form of savings for all workers. Roosevelt used the government to redistribute dollar-based wealth via jobs and taxes - the same government and Federal Reserve bank that guaranteed the gold standard. He saved the nation by taking the power of money away from asset holders, and redirecting it to income earners. The monarchists have been crying about it ever since, even though the neoliberal world order encourages asset acquisition, and taxes income.

At roughly the same time (early 1933), Roosevelt signed Executive Order 6102, forbidding the hoarding of gold coin, gold bullion, and gold certificates. If you held such assets at a private bank, that bank was obligated to send them to the Fed as a reserve deposit. You received face value for that gold, which at the time was roughly $21 per oz. Anyone hoarding gold coins at home risked a $10k fine and ten years in prison, so it made sense to bring the gold to the bank in exchange for paper dollars (or for money on account). After all, the dollars were as good as gold, and by this method over 85 million ounces were consolidated into the Treasury. Only a year later, in order to improve our balance of trade, the Gold Reserve Act was passed and Federal Reserve notes were revalued to $35 per ounce. This remarkable act of financial repression had the most severe effects on the idle rich, who were sitting on dollars rather than assets. But for the vast majority of the people who no longer held or cared about gold, devaluation was just another rich man’s game, and their own lives, jobs, and dollars were hardly affected. In fact, it led to a surge in employment as our exports became more desirable around the world. 

The dollar had been as good as gold, and now it was only as good as its purchasing power. But since gold had been outlawed as a currency and had no purchasing power, the spell was complete: King Dollar was born in the midst of this new gold standard and continuing economic depression. In the years leading up to WWII, the paper dollar utterly dominated commerce in the Western Hemisphere; and after WWII, the Bretton Woods agreement extended the kingdom to the entire “free world”. We convinced the other nations to use dollars, because they were as good as gold: convertible upon request from the US Treasury. We had accumulated an enormous quantity of gold thanks to our export-oriented economy during the war. So, we used the same trick on the rest of the world that we had employed inside the US to establish our dollars as the default unit of trade. But as the nations of the world grew suspicious of our persistent fiscal deficits, they demanded their gold in specie. Our national reserves of gold exceeded 20 kilotons after the war, but had dwindled to less than 10 kilotons by 1971. Nixon suspended the convertibility of the dollar to gold, and put an end to the gold standard. The dollar was now backed by “the full faith and credit” of the US federal government, and not some shiny rocks. The free world grumbled, but kept using the dollar for international settlements and held T-bills in their reserves.

We still live under the reign of King Dollar, but there are some significant changes to how the system operates in the modern world. The World Bank, the IMF, and intrabank messaging systems like SWIFT (and the emerging FedNow service) all work to promote and control the use of the dollar as a reserve currency in almost every nation. The internet, cell phones, and credit cards have transformed markets and payments at the consumer level. The rules for investment and taxes have transformed King Dollar into a system that penalizes workers and savers, in order to protect investors and corporations. Our currency systems have become extremely convenient, but at the cost of enforcing a new financial feudalism and a global trade system fraught with contradictions and corruption. Bitcoin was born in the midst of this modern era, as an effort to make an alternative neutral digital currency; and since that time a number of other cryptocurrencies have been developed to challenge the dollar system. In the next chapter we will be discussing the most technically adept and promising of these systems: the Ergo Platform. 

Decentralization is a key feature of cryptocurrencies: decentralized holdings (tokenomics), decentralized security (mining or staking), and decentralized trading (permissionless, peer to peer payments). No government or single private entity can control Bitcoin, and only severe acts of desperation could halt or stop the network in limited circumstances. This decentralization directly confronts the central banks that control the world’s fiat currencies, including the US dollar. But what else is decentralized, widely available and tradeable, and cannot be debased or controlled by any government, no matter how powerful? Why silver and gold, of course. Gold and silver may be exchanged for local currency in almost every town in the world. 
According to the USGS, there are over 170 kilotons of refined gold in the world, and central banks hold less than 30 kilotons. About half of the total is in jewelry, but there is more gold bullion in private hands than in central bank reserves. Silver is much more crustily abundant than gold: over all human history we have mined around 1700 kilotons of silver, and each year we mine and refine another 25 kilotons. But most of that silver goes to industry, only to end up in landfills; less than 7 kilotons are recycled each year. It is estimated that there are only three billion ounces of fine silver bullion in the world, less than 100 kilotons in total. Silver is a metal that is consumed, not saved. There is not much more silver bullion available today than there is gold bullion; but each are widely distributed around the world, as is the jewelry made from these materials. 

It is obvious why gold is thought of as the monetary metal, given that the mining industry produces less than 2% of the total stock each year, and  because so little is lost to industry. By contrast silver is produced at more than 25% of the total trading stock per year, yet very little of that production is minted into new bullion for sale. If silver becomes more expensive due to mining difficulties or increased demand, then there is an incentive to melt any silver coins or jewelry for industry, which reinforces the scarcity of the coins. Consequently, the value of silver compared to gold (or dollars) is quite volatile, and not suitable as money for commercial purposes: commerce requires money to be a stable unit of account. Nevertheless, the US mint produced 90% silver coinage until 1964, with a circulation well over a billion ounces of what is now often referred to as “junk silver”. This junk silver is widely available in the USA, but rarely used for commerce these days. Silver and gold are HODL’d, just like bitcoin and other fixed supply digital currencies. 

In spite of silver’s slippery market mechanics, Baum and the bimetallists preferred silver to paper dollars, given that the paper dollars of the time had proven to be risky to hold at the bank during financial panics. The people trusted a rare metal with no counterparty risk, compared to notes printed by the same banks that lobbied for the laws that supposedly constrained and regulated them. In any case, there is also a cost to printing (difficult to counterfeit) paper money, and it is expensive to employ trustworthy bankers to keep track of virtual dollars on ledgers. So, while the government was focused on substituting the dollar for gold, they continued to mint silver coinage as a broad currency for local markets. But eventually the seigniorage became too meager as industrial demand for silver increased, while machines made bookkeeping easier for tracking dollars. The digital dollar arrived in the seventies, as computer technology became affordable at the corporate level and credit cards became a widespread convenience. But technology truly magnified the power of finance in the age of the wireless internet, when everyone has a phone in their pocket and taps to pay at the point of sale system. 

How can silver or gold compete with the dollar in this digital age? We’ve just explained how they cannot compete as a form of currency, but both metals are increasingly valuable in dollar terms, over the decades. That says more about the dollar than it does about bullion; most financial assets are outpacing inflation, whether it is stocks, real estate, metals, or productive facilities and equipment. That is because the Federal Reserve is charged with keeping consumer price inflation (CPI) under control, and they are greatly assisted by two strongly deflationary processes: technology and globalization. Technological development drives prices down by increasing worker productivity and by minimizing costs or substituting alternatives for base inputs. Globalization drives down consumer prices by harnessing comparative advantage, by exploiting cheaper labor and commodity markets, and by externalizing and ignoring the environmental costs of production. These deflationary effects have enabled the Fed to print money for decades with an almost reckless abandon without any concern for a significant increase in CPI. But the assets and services that mark genuine wealth have become more valuable (expensive) at a rate that far exceeds CPI. Housing, commercial real estate, healthcare, education, luxury items, stocks, and scarce commodities (like gold and silver) have all increased at double digit rates as the rich bid up the price for scarce assets and services. Meanwhile, wages have been stagnant for almost five decades, and wealth inequality has reached a level comparable to the roaring 20’s. 

Rich people learned that dollars evaporate, and that capital assets appreciate quickly compared to the median wage purchasing power. If the dollar was still backed by gold and silver, then inequality would be less pronounced, but you would not be able to purchase a bicycle for $150 at Walmart. If the typical worker saved their money in assets, they too could keep pace with the economy. But rich people have what is known as a “low marginal propensity to consume”: they spend very little of their large incomes, and invest the rest. The poor man spends it all to feed, clothe, and shelter his family, and the rich man charges rent. When the median income worker buys an asset like their house, they do it on credit, so it is balanced against a liability (owed to the rich). The rich pay cash, because they know the dollar depreciates. The middle class buys on credit, for the same reason; but if they spend frivolously, they will never join the rich. 

“But”, you may say, “the poor man today lives with more comfort than a medieval king.” That might be true, as measured in refrigerators or TV-sets; but not in terms of political power or cultural influence. You may feel secure in your own family future, but there is growing discontent among the general population. That discontent is manifesting in ascendant populist movements around the world, and a fraying of the alliances underpinning globalism. We have already emerged from the zero-interest era, and now we are witnessing trade wars and increasingly active conflicts around the world. Moreover, the technological advances in resource acquisition and value-added manufacturing are mostly at the end of their s-curves, unless you believe that artificial intelligence will revive science and engineering in a way that improves general living standards. In summary, we are witnessing deglobalization.

The powerful forces that enabled King Dollar to rule the world are now winding down, just as the populations of industrialized countries are starting to decrease. The people of the world are waking up to the game, and they are beginning to see dollars as worth less. Consumer price inflation is surging as supply chain disruptions and tariffs eat into the purchasing power of the dollar. Austerity programs lead to inefficiencies and immiseration, decreasing demand and generating yet more discontent and populism. The court of King Dollar has become increasingly cloistered, and the masses are beginning to lose faith. 

It is more difficult and time consuming to create and build, than it is to destroy or to rot from within. Rome may not have been built in a day, but it was sacked and looted on August 24th, 410AD. The concentration of wealth, due to Cantillon effects, tax havens, and frictionless shipping, has created a situation where there is no political will to maintain the global order. When wealth was well distributed, and the middle class was flourishing, everyone had an incentive to maintain the system; but the profits have all accrued to the top, fomenting political populism. The internal politics of the USA will affect global politics, and a destructive feedback loop has ensued. The global order is fragmenting. Technological development is stagnating. King Dollar is under siege.  

What does dedollarization and deglobalization look like in America? Stagflation, financial repression, and a generally diminished standard of living. For the rest of the world, it will be even worse. It’s hard for markets to achieve price discovery when the standard measure is unstable and unreliable. We would all be better off in the short term if King Dollar could survive, so when it comes to another crisis, we will kick the can down the road, as they say. But eventually the road for the dollar comes to an end, just like the yellow brick road ended in Oz. To borrow from Carl von Clausewitz, economics is just an extension of politics, and currency is a sociological phenomenon – especially when based on debt.
