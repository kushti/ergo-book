Welcome to the Ergo Book! 

It presents ideas by Ergo community members on building alternative monetary stack, which does not rely on central and 
private banks and allowing communities and individuals around the globe to enjoy trust-minimized local and global money, 
as well as counter-cyclical tooling for sustainable economies and so on.

The main motivation for the book is to provide ideological background as well as technological stack description to help 
communities and individuals struggling when fiat currency is collapsing or not so available due to uneven and also 
usually unfair distribution of new money in fiat systems.

In the center of proposed stack we put Ergo, a blockchain created to provide resilient basis for building global and 
politically neutral inclusive monetary systems, and its native proof-of-work asset ERG with finite algorithmically 
defined supply.
