Welcome to the Ergo Book! This compilation of writings is aiming to cover a broad of important topics, starting from ideological roots of Ergo cryptocurrency, to technical details of layer-two constructions. The main theme behind all the topics is paving ways to global widespread adoption of Ergo and assets on top of it for building alternative monetary and payment systems (where conventional ones are failing or not enough), counter-cyclical tooling for sustainable economies and so on.
